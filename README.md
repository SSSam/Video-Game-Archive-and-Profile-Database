# Video Game Archive and Profile Database
We have implemented our database management system for a video game and profile archive using HTML, PHP, CSS, and SQL. Users can rate games on a scale out of ten and our database saves these ratings along with other information such as user data, including what preferences each user has. We also save information on the games, such as what platform the game is played on, what genres it falls into, and information on the game publishers.  

We have created various functions to manage our database. Our basic functions are adding a game, adding a player, updating players' names, and deleting a user. Our higher level functions are: searching a game based on publication year; searching games in a certain genre; searching games via their popularity (returns games higher than a certain number of monthly active users); searching users who have rated all games; searching the highest and lowest rating in the database, giving options for choosing what platform to join with games, as well as many other data available directly in the database tab for usersâ€™ references.

This project can be further developed with more graphics/UI, more searches, greater functionality, and bigger database size. The security of this project was not in consideration, yet we believe these can be the other areas that we may develop further in the future if possible.
